                                 Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, is
                                 the largest city in Turkey, serving as the
                                 country's economic, cultural and historic hub.
                                 The city straddles the Bosporus strait, lying
                                 in both Europe and Asia, and has a population
                                 of over 15 million residents, comprising 19% of
                                 the population of Turkey. Istanbul is the most
                                 populous European city, and the world's
                                 15th-largest city.

                                 The city was founded as Byzantium (Byzantion)
                                 in the 7th century BC by Greek settlers from
                                 Megara. In 330 CE, the Roman emperor
                                 Constantine the Great made it his imperial
                                 capital, renaming it first as New Rome (Nova
                                 Roma)and then as Constantinople
                                 (Constantinopolis) after himself. The city grew
                                 in size and influence, eventually becoming a
                                 beacon of the Silk Road and one of the most
                                 important cities in history.

                                 Troy or Ilium was an ancient city located at

                                 (19 mi) south-west of Çanakkale. It is known as
                                 the setting for the Greek myth of the Trojan
                                 War.

                                 In Ancient Greek literature, Troy is portrayed
                                 as a powerful kingdom of the Heroic Age, a
                                 mythic era when monsters roamed the earth and
                                 gods interacted directly with humans. The city
                                 was said to have ruled the Troad until the
                                 Trojan War led to its complete destruction at
                                 the hands of the Greeks. The story of its
                                 destruction was one of the cornerstones of
                                 Greek mythology and literature, featuring
                                 prominently in the Iliad and the Odyssey, as
                                 well as numerous other poems and plays. Its
                                 legacy played a large role in Greek society,
                                 with many prominent families claiming descent
                                 from those who had fought there. In the Archaic
                                 era, a new city was built at the site where
                                 legendary Troy was believed to have stood. In
                                 the Classical era, this city became a tourist
                                 destination, where visitors would leave
                                 offerings to the legendary heroes.

                                 on the south-west coast of Turkey. The town is
                                 an independent municipality, within the
                                 administrative district of Ortaca.

                                 Dalyan achieved international fame in 1987 when
                                 developers wanted to build a luxury hotel on
                                 the nearby İztuzu Beach, a breeding ground for
                                 the endangered loggerhead sea turtle species.
                                 The incident created major international storm
                                 when David Bellamy championed the cause of
                                 conservationists such as June Haimoff, Peter
                                 Günther, Nergis Yazgan, Lily Venizelos and
                                 Keith Corbett. The development project was
                                 temporarily stopped after Prince Philip called
                                 for a moratorium and in 1988 the beach and its
                                 hinterland were declared a protected area, viz.

                                 Life in Dalyan revolves around the Dalyan Çayı
                                 River which flows past the town. The boats that
                                 ply up and down the river, navigating the maze
                                 of reeds, are the preferred means of transport

                                 Aksaray, Kırşehir, Sivas and Niğde provinces in

                                 Since the late 300s BC the name Cappadocia came
                                 to be restricted to the inland province
                                 (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), Upper
                                 Cappadocia, which alone will be the focus of

                                 According to Herodotus, in the time of the
                                 Ionian Revolt (499 BC), the Cappadocians were
                                 reported as occupying a region from Mount
                                 Taurus to the vicinity of the Euxine (Black
                                 Sea). Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in
                                 the south by the chain of the Taurus Mountains
                                 that separate it from Cilicia, to the east by
